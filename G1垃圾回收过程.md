### The G1 Garbage Collector Step by Step

## 1、**G1 Heap Structure**

```
The heap is one memory area split into many fixed sized regions.Region size is chosen by the JVM at startup. The JVM generally targets around 2000 regions varying in size from 1 to 32Mb.
```

```
堆是一个内存区域，分成许多固定大小的区域。 区域大小由 JVM 在启动时选择。 Jvm 通常针对大约2000个大小从1到32Mb 不等的区域。（最小2G，最大62G？）
```

## 2、**G1 Heap Allocation**

```
In reality, these regions are mapped into logical representations of Eden, Survivor, and old generation spaces.The colors in the picture shows which region is associated with which role. Live objects are evacuated (i.e., copied or moved) from one region to another. Regions are designed to be collected in parallel with or without stopping all other application threads.
```

```
实际上，这些区域都有一个角色（Eden, Survivor, and old generation）。 图中的颜色显示了哪个区域与哪个角色相关联。 Live objects被从一个区域evacuated到另一个区域(即复制或移动)。 区域被设计为在停止所有其他应用程序线程时并行收集或不停止所有其他应用程序线程。
```

```
As shown regions can be allocated into Eden, survivor, and old generation regions. In addition, there is a fourth type of object known as Humongous regions. These regions are designed to hold objects that are 50% the size of a standard region or larger. They are stored as a set of contiguous regions. Finally the last type of regions would be the unused areas of the heap.

Note: At the time of this writing, collecting humongous objects has not been optimized. Therefore, you should avoid creating objects of this size. 
```

```
如图所示，区域可分为Eden, survivor, and old generation。 此外，还有第四种类型Humongous。 这些区域被设计用来容纳标准区域大小的50% 或更大的对象。 它们被存储为一组连续的区域。 最后一种类型的区域是堆中未使用的区域。（是因为一般不会创建大对象吗？那这部分空间岂不是被浪费掉了？）

注意: 在写这篇文章的时候，收集巨大的对象还没有被优化。 因此，应该避免创建这种大小的对象。
```

## 3、**Young Generation in G1**

```
The heap is split into approximately 2000 regions. Minimum size is 1Mb and maximum size is 32Mb. Blue regions hold old generation objects and green regions hold young generation objects.
Note that the regions are not required to be contiguous like the older garbage collectors.
```

```
注意，不需要像旧的垃圾收集器那样要求区域是连续的。
```

## 4、**A Young GC in G1**

```
Live objects are evacuated (i.e., copied or moved) to one or more survivor regions. If the aging threshold is met, some of the objects are promoted to old generation regions.
```

```
This is a stop the world (STW) pause. Eden size and survivor size is calculated for the next young GC. Accounting information is kept to help calculate the size. Things like the pause time goal are taken into consideration.

This approach makes it very easy to resize regions, making them bigger or smaller as needed.
```

```
Young GC会stop the world。计算eden大小和survivor大小，for the next young GC。Accounting information是什么？  诸如暂停时间目标这样的事情也被考虑在内。 这种方法使得调整区域大小变得非常容易，可以根据需要调整区域的大小。
```

## 5、**End of a Young GC with G1**

```
Live objects have been evacuated to survivor regions or to old generation regions.Recently promoted objects are shown in dark blue. Survivor regions in green.In summary, the following can be said about the young generation in G1:

    -The heap is a single memory space split into regions.
    -Young generation memory is composed of a set of non-contiguous regions. This makes it easy to resize when needed.
    -Young generation garbage collections, or young GCs, are stop the world events. All application threads are stopped for the operation.
    -The young GC is done in parallel using multiple threads.
    -Live objects are copied to new survivor or old generation regions.

```

## 6、**Initial Marking Phase**

```
Initial marking of live object is piggybacked on a young generation garbage collection. In the logs this is noted as GC pause (young)(inital-mark).
```

```
Initial marking是基于a young generation garbage collection。在日志中被记录为GC pause (young)(inital-mark).
```

## 7、**Concurrent Marking Phase**

```
If empty regions are found (as denoted by the "X"), they are removed immediately in the Remark phase. Also, "accounting" information that determines liveness is calculated.
```

```
如果找到空区域(如“ x”所示) ，则在 Remark 阶段立即删除它们。 此外，“accounting”信息，决定liveness的计算。
```

## 8、**Remark Phase**

```
Empty regions are removed and reclaimed. Region liveness is now calculated for all regions.
```

```
空区域被删除并回收。现在计算所有区域的Region liveness。
```

## 9、**Copying/Cleanup Phase**

```
G1 selects the regions with the lowest "liveness", those regions which can be collected the fastest. Then those regions are collected at the same time as a young GC. This is denoted in the logs as [GC pause (mixed)]. So both young and old generations are collected at the same time.
```

```
G1选择“活性”最低的区域，也就是收集速度最快的区域。 然后，这些区域将在young GC的时候收集。 这在日志中表示为[ GC pause (mixed)]。 所以young and old generations在同一时间收集。
```

## 10、**After Copying/Cleanup Phase**

```
The regions selected have been collected and compacted into the dark blue region and the dark green region shown in the diagram.
```

```
所选区域已被收集并压缩为图中所示的深蓝色区域和深绿色区域。
```
